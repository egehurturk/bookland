# Project1 With CS50


In this app, I made a book-review website that mainly has 4 features: Searching for books, book detail page, adding reviews / being able to see other users' comments, and lastly, signing in and login logout.

Users can also see the JSON formatting of any book's information by simply adding the route "api/<isbn>" to the main URL, where <isbn> is the isbn number of a book

This app has been made by flask, python, PSQL, and also html css. This project lasted for about 5 days, which I spent approximately 2-3 hours everyday for this particular project.


# I'VE ALSO USED CANVA FOR DESIGNING THE LOGO AND THE DARK OVERLAY OF THE BACKGROUND IMAGE
